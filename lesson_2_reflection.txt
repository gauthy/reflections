What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

  when u intit a repository it creates a .git directory in the folder which helps us keep track of the chnages in the directory.
  
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?


   staging area is which we add files before we do a commit . working directory includes all the commits.
